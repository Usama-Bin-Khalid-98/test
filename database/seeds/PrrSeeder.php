2	The Context
(1 paragraph of about 10 lines, on the basic information of the business school, programs under accreditation and general observations).
Name (BUSINESS MANAGEMENT Dept.) is a major business school in Pakistan. It is part of a very dynamic and well reputed XYZ.  With its custom built campus and solid reputation in the job market in several areas, XYZ provides Dept. of Business management several advantages. Besides DEPT. OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT that provides nearly 80% of student revenue, XYZ has Colleges of Economics, Computer Science and Industrial Management, and Engineering and Sciences. With 20 acres of land, seven buildings comprising 600,000 covered area and housing 100 class rooms, examination halls, library, computing labs, faculty offices, student activity center and own 1200 KVA power generation unit, XYZ has excellent physical infrastructure for its DEPT. OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT and other colleges with a total student strength of 3500-4000.
The peer review team (PRT) held detailed formal and informal discussions with the Rector XYZ, (Name), and the Dean of DEPT. OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT, (Name), and his colleagues in DEPT. OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT while reviewing the self-assessment report in detail. PRT also had the opportunity to discuss the overall vision, mission and strategy of XYZ with the Rector. PRT also met various HODs, faculty members and senior members of the administrative staff of DEPT. OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT to understand how the school is addressing the various dimensions that are included in the NBEAC standards. The PRT also had the opportunity to meet students of BBA and MBA programs and some Alumni besides visiting various facilities like the library and computing laboratories. PRT members also sat through some class sessions and also informally interacted with the students in the walkways and after classes. PRT is obliged to the Dean, and the DEPT. OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT staff for preparing the visit schedule, providing all the logistical support and facilitating the smooth conduct of our visit.
3	General Observations

It was noticed right at the beginning of the peer review visit that there has been a change of leadership at the Dean level at DEPT. OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT only recently. Although Dean(Name) was highly cooperative but given that he had only recently assumed the role at the Dean he had to rely on several of his colleagues for providing detailed responses to PRT questions. It is suggested that in such cases where there is a change in the leadership of the school undergoing NBEAC process at period of at least six months must be  given to the new Dean  to settle down before scheduling of the peer review team visit.
