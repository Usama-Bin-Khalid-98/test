'<p>Dear Professor Dr. Noor Ahmed Memon,</p>'+

'<p>Reference to the registration application received for accreditation on August 9, 2019, this is to inform you that the Initial Eligibility Screening (IES) is completed by the Eligibility Screening Committee (ESC).</p>'+

'<ol>'+
'<li><strong>The case of KASBIT, Karachi has been deferred till the 09th ESC meeting to be held in Jan 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></li>'+
'<li>The University must avail mentorship to accomplish the following areas of improvement/recommendations:</li>'+
'<li>Strategic plan is weak as there are no precise timelines, no KPIs (just intent) and no resource allocation provided in it. There are grammatical errors in the mission and vision statement and they are not aligned with the values. Some of the values are simple statements and could not be considered as values. The university needs mentorship to improve the strategic plan.</li>'+
'<li>Documentary evidences of approval of strategic plan is required &ndash; the strategic plan should be approved by a relevant statutory body including the representation of Vice Chancellor and Dean.</li>'+
'<li>Several deficiencies have been observed in the profile of dean including the publication criteria, experience etc.</li>'+
'<li>Following documents should be provided with the registration application in 9th ESC Meeting:'+
'<ol>'+
'<li>CV of HoD and associate professor</li>'+
'<li>R&amp; D data for period of 2017 to 2019.</li>'+
'</ol>'+
'</li>'+
'</ol>'+

'<ol>'+
'<li>Based on the above recommendations, it is decided that University should reapply after availing mentorship and fulfilling the major deficiencies, preferably for the 9th Eligibility Screening Committee Meeting. Deadline to submit the registration application is December 30th, 2019.</li>'+
'<li>It is mandatory that the University seeks guidance through the process of pre- eligibility mentor visit (Section III of NBEAC Accreditation Process Manual). We can provide you expert opinion/ assistance through our mentors, who will facilitate you during the accreditation process. Therefore, kindly contact Ms. Sania Tufail at (92) 51 90800206, email: stufail@hec.gov.pk for further information and assistance.</li>'+
