<p class="left">3.	Enrollment means total number of students enrolled from first semester to last semester of a program. 16 years study programs include BBA/B.Com; 18 years programs include MS/MPhil/MBA/MPA/M.Com et cetera. </p>
<p class="left">4.	Year t, Year t-1, and Year t-2 correspond to last three years i.e. Year t means current year, Year t-1 is the last year, and Year t-2 is the year before last year. As annual data is required, therefore each year includes both fall & spring sessions. Please replace row headers with actual years.</p>
<p class="left">5.	This column shows the total annual enrollment of the school/department as a whole, not just the program(s) under accreditation.</p>
<p class="left">6.	Intake means the number of students taking admissions in the program in that year including total students of fall and spring semester.</p>
<p class="left">7.	This column shows the total annual intake of the school/department as a whole, not just the program(s) under accreditation</p>
<p class="left">8.	Suppose there were total 120 students admitted in the first semester of a batch. During the course of the program, 8 students were dropped out due to academic reasons e.g. low CGPA, while there were 2 other students who disjoined the program due to reasons such as transferred to some other campus of the same university, joined some other university, or discontinued studies for any personal reasons et cetera. Out of the left over 110 students (110= 120-8-2), 90 students graduated in time while 20 students will graduate later as they might have a few courses remaining. In this way, success percentage is to be calculated as [(Already graduated student of the batch + Students of the same batch who will graduate later)/ Total admitted students in the first semester of the batch * 100]. Similarly, drop out percentage is to be calculated as [Students dropped out due to academic reasons/ Total admitted students in the first semester of the batch * 100].</p>
<p class="left">9.	Financial assistance types includes tuition grant on merit, tuition grant on need, loans and work study arrangements. </p>
<p class="left">10.	Extra-curricular activities such as sports, debates, dramas, music and co-curricular activities such as conferences, presentations, business plan competition, case simulations etc.</p>
